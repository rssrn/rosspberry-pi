So I have: a pi 3B, a 16GB microSD card, an ethernet cable, a power supply, and a linux laptop (with microSD card reader).

1) Download and flash an OS (picked raspbian as the obvious choice) to the microSD using Etcher and the [instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md) from raspberrypi.org.

At time of writing, latest available was 2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie so that's what I installed.  I went with the 'with pixel' version because, hey I've got enough space and it might be useful or interesting.


2) I'm doing a headless install because I don't have a monitor or USB keyboard.  So I need to enable ssh automatically when the pi starts up.
